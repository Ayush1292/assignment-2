# assignment-2
task 1
first we take the input from the user 
We used if else and modulor operator to check whether the number is even or odd.
if number is even or upon dividing by 2 give 0 then print even and else odd.

task 2
We first initialize a varible "a" and "count" which is equal to zero.
Than we use while loop such that we add the increment variable "count" in "a" and assign that value to "a" everytime.
from this we can add incremented varible simultanously and get the desired result.
